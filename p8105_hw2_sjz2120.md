# Problem 1

## Data Import and Cleaning

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. First we use import the
data using `read_csv()`, update variable names, and select the columns
that will be used in later in this homework. We update the variable
`entry` from `yes` / `no` to a logical variable. As part of the data
import, we specify that `Route` columns 8-11 should be character for
consistency with columns 1-7.

``` r
subway_data =
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
           col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"),
         entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE ))
```

We still need to “tidy” up subway_data a bit. For instance, route number
and route should be variables, so we need to convert all of the `route`
variables from wide to long format. This will be useful when focusing on
specific routes, but may not be necessary when considering questions
that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` from `dplyr` to select only unique/distinct rows from the
data frame. As a result, the number of rows in this dataset will be
equal to the number of unique stations. We see that there are 465 unique
stations.

``` r
subway_data %>%
  select(station_name, line) %>%
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

In the next code chunk we now filter according to ADA compliance as an
initial step. This produces a dataframe where the number of rows is
equal to the number of ADA compliant stations. We see that there are 84
ADA compliant stations.

``` r
subway_data %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
that allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not
allow vending using `filter()`. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable
using `pull()`. Since `entry` is a logical variable, we’re able to get
to the proportion we want by taking the mean of `entry` (since R will
treat logical as numeric when taking the mean). We see that the
proportion of station entrances / exits without vending that allow
entrance is 0.3770492 or about 37.70% of station entrances / exits.

``` r
subway_data %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

For the last part of Question 1, we need to write a code chunk to
identify stations that serve the A train, and to assess how many of
these are ADA compliant. First, we tidy the data by converting `route`
from wide to long format. Next, we can use tools from previous parts of
the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and on ADA compliance;
selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes with the required
stations in rows). We see that 60 stations serve the A train, and 17 of
these stations are ADA compliant.

``` r
subway_data %>%
    pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

# Problem 2

*This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:*

-   specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read_excel
-   use reasonable variable names
-   omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
-   round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

``` r
mr_trash_data =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N534") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

*Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel, and combine this with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset
to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is
which, you may need to add an additional variable to both datasets
before combining.*

``` r
prof_trash_data =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N117") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

In the next code chunk, we combine the data for Professor Trash Wheel
and the Mr. Trash Wheel datasets to produce a single tidy dataset while
keeping track of which Trash Wheel is which.

``` r
mr_trash_data =
  mutate(mr_trash_data, mr_prof = 0)

prof_trash_data =
  mutate(prof_trash_data, mr_prof = 1)

both_trash_data = 
  full_join(mr_trash_data, prof_trash_data)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight", "volume",
    ## "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts", "glass_bottles",
    ## "grocery_bags", "chip_bags", "sports_balls", "homes_powered", "mr_prof")

``` r

*Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020?*

### Describing the Joined Dataframe for Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel Data

The joined dataset for Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheels Data
contains a total of **524 rows/observations** and **15
columns/variables** (including an extra newly created variable from the
previous code chunk, which we used to keep track of which original
dataset an observation came from).

Key variables for the both_trash_data joined dataframe include:
**dumpster, month, year, date, weight, volume, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
sports_balls, homes_powered, mr_prof**. All of these variables with the
exception of `mr_prof` were from the original datasets. All of these
variables were numeric types (specifically, doubles) with the exception
of:

-   **1 integer variable:** `Sports Balls`
-   **1 character variable:** `Month`
-   **1 date/posix variable** `Date`

**For available data, the total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel was 135.5 tons**.

**The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020
was 856 sports balls**.
